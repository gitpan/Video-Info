Revision history for Perl extension Video::Info.

0.99  Skipping waaaaay up!  Major changes this release.  Quicktime
      support has been added via OpenQuicktime.  This means new depen-
      dencies on Inline::C and the OpenQuicktime C library itself.
      Apologies to non-linux users... someone code me a pure-perl
      module that follows the "FOO.pm" and "FOO.t" format, and I'll
      add it.

      Once I'm sure all the problems are worked out, I'll bump the
      revision to 1.00.

      Another major change is the license.  I've moved the modules
      to the Aladding Free Public License, which is very explicit
      about prohibiting commercial use.  Personal users, treat it
      like a GPL.  Commercial users, contact me <allenday@ucla.edu>
      for a license.

      Thanks to William Scott Hoge and Steven Lembark for their help
      with the Quicktime format.

0.08  Added documentation missing for some methods
      Added minutes() method
      Added MMSS() method for Minutes:Seconds format
      Internal changes for how acodec() and acodecraw() are processed

0.07  ASF Mapping was not correct.  Fixed.
      Added new audio codecs.
      Added preliminary support for ID3 tagged MP3

0.06  Minor fix to the MANIFEST

0.05  Added Magic for determining filetypes by first 4 bytes.  Largely
      derived from magic(1)

      Video::Info seems to be working as a factory class for RIFF::Info
      and ASF::Info objects.

      Audio codec hex->name mapping moved into Magic.pm from RIFF::Info

      Added methods for ASF author/rating/copyright/etc info.  May also
      apply to MPEG video, and certainly MP2/3.
