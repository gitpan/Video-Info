Revision history for Perl extension Video::Info.

0.10  Added filename() and filesize() methods for returning the path to
      the file used to create the object, as well as its size (in bytes).

0.09  Added afrequency() method for retrieving audio channel sampling
      frequency (Corren Vorwerk)
      No longer using warnings.pm because of problems with ActiveState Perl
      (Alex Polomski)

0.08  Added documentation missing for some methods
      Added minutes() method
      Added MMSS() method for Minutes:Seconds format
      Internal changes for how acodec() and acodecraw() are processed
      Added recognition for RIFF-CDXA and RIFF-WAV files.  Video::Info
        now attempts to create an Audio::WAV object for RIFF-WAV.
      Added placeholders for DV::PAL/NTSC (Digital Video formats, from
        camcorders and the like).  Parsers haven't been written for DV yet.
      Addded dimensions() method that returns width() x height() scalar.
      length() is now an alias for duration().

0.07  ASF Mapping was not correct.  Fixed.
      Added new audio codecs.
      Added preliminary support for ID3 tagged MP3

0.06  Minor fix to the MANIFEST

0.05  Added Magic for determining filetypes by first 4 bytes.  Largely
      derived from magic(1)

      Video::Info seems to be working as a factory class for RIFF::Info
      and ASF::Info objects.

      Audio codec hex->name mapping moved into Magic.pm from RIFF::Info

      Added methods for ASF author/rating/copyright/etc info.  May also
      apply to MPEG video, and certainly MP2/3.
