Revision history for Perl extension Video::Info.

0.05  Added Magic for determining filetypes by first 4 bytes.  Largely
      derived from magic(1)

      Video::Info seems to be working as a factory class for RIFF::Info
      and ASF::Info objects.

      Audio codec hex->name mapping moved into Magic.pm from RIFF::Info

      Added methods for ASF author/rating/copyright/etc info.  May also
      apply to MPEG video, and certainly MP2/3.
